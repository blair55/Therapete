            <h2>Indian Head Massage</h2>
            <p>
Indian Head Massage is based on the Ayurvedic system of healing which has been practiced in India for over a thousand years. 'Champi' is an original Hindi word meaning head massage and Champissage is the modern name for the Ayurvedic method of head massage.
The aim of Indian Head Massage is to release the stress that has accumulated in the joints, tissues and muscles of the head, face, neck, upper back and shoulders. Originally, the technique only included the head whereas today, however; it includes massage of the shoulders, upper back, arms and neck, and face and ears.
The client, fully clothed, sits in a massage chair or lays on a massage couch for the treatment. Deep kneading and compression movements are used over the neck, shoulder and scalp areas. The session will usually last from twenty to forty-five minutes.

            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            <p>
Indian Head Massage helps increase joint mobility and flexibility in the neck and shoulders while improving blood circulation and lymphatic flow. It frees knots of muscular tension, relaxes connective tissue and aids in the elimination of accumulated toxins and waste products. It is particularly good for reducing the effects of stress, tension, fatigue, insomnia, headaches, migraine and sinusitis.
Clients report that the experience is deeply calming and relaxing, leaving them feeling energised and revitalised and better able to concentrate.
