            <h2>Deep Tissue Massage</h2>
            <p>
Deep Tissue Massage is a massage technique that focuses on the deeper layers of muscle tissue. It aims to release the chronic patterns of tension in the body through slow strokes and deep finger, knuckle and elbow pressure on the contracted areas, either following or going across the fibers of the muscles, tendons and fascia.
Deep Tissue Massage is used to release chronic muscle tension through slower strokes and more direct deep pressure or friction applied across the grain of the muscles rather than with the grain. As with the Swedish Body Massage, Deep Tissue Massage helps to break up and eliminate scar tissue. Deep Tissue Massage usually focuses on more specific areas and may cause some soreness during or right after the massage, however; if the massage is done correctly you should feel better than ever within a day or two. 
Deep Tissue Massage takes place on a massage couch and oils are used to reduce friction to the skin. The sessions are usually 30, 60 or 90 minutes.

            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            <p>
Deep Tissue Massage helps loosen muscle tissues, breakdown scar tissue adhesions, reduces muscle spasms, pain and tension, improves mobility, release toxins from muscles and get blood and oxygen circulating properly, while relaxing and soothing the muscle tissue. It is both corrective and therapeutic. It helps improve the functioning of the internal organs and any associated symptoms or diseases, improves posture and mobility and also helps to reduce tension and the automatic reflexes to stress.
Because many toxins are released, it's important to drink plenty of water after a Deep-Tissue session to help eliminate these toxins from the body.
