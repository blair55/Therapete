            <h2>Swedish Massage</h2>
            <p>
Body massage originated in Sweden. Swedish Body Massage is the original massage technique involving a sequence of movements working superficially and into the tissue layers. It is a system of treatment designed to energise and stimulate the body; encouraging circulation. The treatment incorporates light and deep movements, allowing your mind and body to unwind through the release of tension from your muscles, also stimulating your body's circulatory systems.
Movements such as effleurage work over the skin with the palm of the hand producing relaxation, whereas movements like petrissage work deeply. Petrissage movements such as wringing and kneading will help to relieve tension promoting deep relaxation in the tissues and muscles. 
Swedish Body Massage takes place on a massage couch and oils are used to reduce friction to the skin. The sessions are usually 30, 60 or 90 minutes.

            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            <p>
The many benefits of Swedish Body Massage may include relaxation, breakdown of scar tissue adhesions, reduction in muscle spasms, pain and tension, improved mobility, release of endorphins; the body's natural painkillers and improved blood circulation, which may speed healing and reduce swelling from injury. Improving the condition of the skin and the warmth created will help relax the body physically and mentally, balancing the overall flow of natural life energy through the body.
