            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                TheraPete specialise in Seated Acupressure Massage (also known as On Site Massage). Based on a traditional Japanese technique, which aims to stimulate pressure points along the Meridian lines, it helps promote the flow of energy, or Ki. Unlike most massage therapists who follow a strict routine called the KATA, TheraPete use their background in Indian Head Massage, Deep Tissue and Holistic Massage, and incorporate Thai Massage stretches to adapt to an individual's needs.
            </p>
            <p>
               Work is usually really stressful, and having to rush to a massage session at lunch time and keeping an eye on the clock, often undoes the benefits of the therapy. With TheraPete we come to you. You get all the wide-ranging benefits of a massage, without the stress of rushing back to your desk after the treatment. You feel the effects immediately; helping you to relax tense muscles, calm and focus the mind, feel more energised, refreshed, alert and ready to face the rest of the day, all without leaving your office!
            </p>
            <p>
               A confident and experienced therapist leads to a better massage for the client. TheraPete have massaged in universities, offices, for charities, at festivals and various events, along with regularly doing community work, reflecting their philosophy that massage is a necessity, not a luxury. Knowing not just the structure of the body, but how the mind affects the body and vice versa is our key to providing successful massages and leaving our clients satisfied. Stimulation coupled with relaxation is the goal. A massage is a good break from the stresses of a constantly ringing phone, whilst also stimulating the mind and readying you for the rest of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
               TheraPete's extensive massage knowledge and experience, combined with their unique versatility, ensures you will receive a tailored therapy session.
