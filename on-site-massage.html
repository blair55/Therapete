            <h2>On Site Massage</h2>
            <p>
Seated Acupressure Massage (sometimes also called On-Site Massage) is based on the traditional Japanese acupressure technique called Anma. Anma is Japanese for 'press and rub' and this therapy aims to stimulate the acupressure points in the head, neck, shoulders, arms, spine and back.
Traditionally, the basic sequence that is taught today lasts no more than 20 minutes, which makes Seated Acupressure Massage the ideal treatment for the busy workplace environment where employees benefit from this quick, dynamic de-stressing therapy and can return to their desks buzzing with energy.
The client, fully dressed, sits facing forward in an ergonomically designed massage chair. As the client relaxes and lays their forehead and arms on a padded rest specifically designed for the purpose, pressure is applied by the thumb, finger, elbow and knuckle to the acupressure points on the client's, back, upper arms, neck, shoulders and head. This press and release technique helps to stimulate and balance the flow of energy or life-force throughout the body.
